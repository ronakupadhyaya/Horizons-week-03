# Week 3 Day 1 Morning Videos & Individual Exercises

Today we will take the first step to building backend servers! In order to accomplish this feat we will first focus on being able to run javascript outside the web browsers.
This day focusses on NodeJS a popular web technology that lets you run javascript without firing up a browser.

Today you will also be using the command line for most of the work you do. If you arent yet familiar with the command line feel free to use the resources at the bottom of this document.

## Section 1: Introduction to NodeJS

### [Watch me: Node Introduction](https://vimeo.com/234328176)

### Section 1a. NodeJS

1. [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
2. Run the following code snippet using node.

    When you are successful you will see the text "Hello NodeJS" in your terminal window. Note that you will need to create a script file with the code and then run it using "node myfilename.js".

    ```
        console.log("Hello NodeJS");
    ```

## Section 2. Builtin `global` and `process` objects

### [Watch me: Introduction to `global` and `process`](https://vimeo.com/234331415)
### [Watch me: `process.argv`](https://vimeo.com/234333873)
### [Watch me: `process.env`](https://vimeo.com/234328292)

The goal of this exercise to implement your very own command line
tool `sum.js`

- `sum.js` should take optional command line arguments, parse the
  arguments into numbers and return their sum. Use
  **`process.argv`** to read command line arguments.

  ```bash
  node sum.js 1 2
  > 3
  node sum.js 2 3 4 5
  > 14
  node sum.js 2 -5 3
  > 0
  ```

Bonus:
- If no command line arguments are specified, you should ask the
  user for 2 numbers and print their sum.

  

  ```bash
  node sum.js
  > Enter first number?
  > 1
  > Enter second number?
  > 4
  > 5
  ```

[Reading input from terminal](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_readline)

```
    // Example code for getting input from the user
    var readline = require('readline');

    var rl = readline.createInterface({
        input: process.stdin,
        output: process.stdout
    });

    rl.question("Hi! What's your name? ", function(name) {
        console.log('Nice to meet you', name);
        rl.close();
    });
```

## Section 3. Builtin `require` keyword

### [Watch me: `require` and `module.exports`](https://vimeo.com/234328258)
### [Watch me: `__filename` and `__dirname`](https://vimeo.com/234328077)

### Section 3a. Practice using `require`

Using `module.exports`, `require`, and your knowledge of relative paths run the functions in the functions across in ascending numeric order. You are only allowed to modify `main.js` and you are not allowed to type `console.log`. You also should not move any folders around.

1. Navigate to `/week03/day1/examples/paths`: This is the folder you will be working in
1. Look through the folder structure to identify where the scripts `main.js`, `one.js`, `two.js`, `three.js`, and `four.js` are located.
1. Modify only `main.js` so that you run all the functions in `one.js`, then the function in `two.js`, and finally the function in `three.js` with the first argument as value exported by `four.js` under the key `horizons`. The output should be a diagonal line.
1. Note: the example code in `main.js` uses `five.js` to help illustrate the directions.

## Section 4. File Input/Output

### [Watch me: `fs` builtin module file input](https://vimeo.com/234328095)
### [Watch me: `fs` builtin module file output](https://vimeo.com/234328120)

### Section 4a. Practice file input and output

Using `process.argv`, and your knowledge of `fs` modify `main.js` in the `countio` folder so that it supports the following:

1. running the `main.js` script adds a line to the `log.txt` file with a timestamp for the current time.
1. running `main.js -s` or `main.js --stats` returns the total number of times the `main.js` program has been run along with the first and last time it was run. Note: running with `-s` or `--stats` flag should not add a timestamp or increment any counters. 

1. Navigate to `/week03/day1/examples/countio`: This is the folder you will be working in
