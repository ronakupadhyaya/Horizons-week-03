Take a look at data.json; this is a list of student info that contians first_name, last_name, email, and gender.
Create a Handlebars template under views that, given an array of students, displays their first name, last name, and email in a list.

<p> Student info:

  {{#each datax}}
    {{this.first_name}} {{this.last_name}} {{this.email}}
  {{/each }}

  </p>
