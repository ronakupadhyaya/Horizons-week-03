# Pair programming exercise: Maze solver using graph traversal

## Goal

In this exercise we're going to implement the maze solver we implemented
in week 1 using graph traversal.

## Instructions

- Instructions and code are in `graph_maze.js`
- Test are in `graph_maze_tests.js`
- To run tests open `graph_maze.html`
